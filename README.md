ATD8
====

Source code from demo app that I did on Microsoft ATD8 conference. Demo consist of 2 projects, one ASP.NET WebAPI rest service and one WinRT (Win8) client application. It's a simple TODO app to demonstrate usage of REST service in WinRT with HttpClient class, MVVM pattern (MVVMLight) and JSON serialization/deserialization (JSON.NET).
